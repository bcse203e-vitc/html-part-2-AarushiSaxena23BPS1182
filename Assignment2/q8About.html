            <h1>About Cologne Cathedral</h1>
            <p>The Cologne Cathedral (Kölner Dom) is a magnificent example of Gothic architecture and one of Germany's most famous landmarks. Standing tall in the heart of Cologne, it is not only the largest cathedral in Germany but also the third-largest in Europe. Its construction began in 1248, and despite numerous interruptions due to financial constraints, wars, and changing architectural trends, the cathedral was finally completed in 1880, after more than 600 years. The cathedral’s stunning twin spires, which soar to a height of 157 meters, make it the tallest church building in Germany and a defining feature of the Cologne skyline. Its intricate façade, adorned with sculptures and stained glass windows, showcases the skill of medieval craftsmen and artists. Inside, the cathedral houses a wealth of priceless treasures, including the Relics of the Three Kings, which have made it an important destination for Christian pilgrims. The cathedral's enormous interior can accommodate over 20,000 people and is home to some of the most stunning medieval artwork and sculptures in the world. The Cologne Cathedral was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996, recognizing its cultural and historical significance. Beyond its religious importance, it remains a symbol of resilience, having survived air raids during World War II that left much of the city in ruins. Today, it continues to attract millions of visitors from around the world, who come to marvel at its awe-inspiring architecture, learn about its rich history, and experience the sense of wonder it has inspired for centuries.</p>
