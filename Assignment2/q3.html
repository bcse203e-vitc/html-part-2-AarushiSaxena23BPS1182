            <h4>To-Do List Application</h4>
            <p>I built a basic to-do list application using Python with a text-based interface. The program allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks. I used a list to store tasks and a loop to display the current list. Each task is stored as a dictionary with keys for the task description and completion status. When a user selects an option, the program prompts for the task details and updates the list. The tasks are saved to a file so that they persist after closing the program.</p>

            <h4>Palindrome Checker</h4>
            <p>For the palindrome checker, I wrote a Python program that takes an input string and checks whether it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). I used string manipulation methods such as .lower() to ignore case sensitivity and .replace() to remove spaces. I then reversed the string using slicing ([::-1]) and compared it to the original string. If both strings matched, the program would output that the input is a palindrome; otherwise, it would return that it's not.</p>

            <h4>Temperature Converter</h4>
            <p>I created a simple temperature converter program in Java. The user can input a temperature and select the unit they want to convert from (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin). The program then performs the necessary conversions using simple mathematical formulas, such as Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32 and Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15. I used a switch statement to handle different conversion options and formatted the output neatly for clarity. The program also includes basic error handling for invalid inputs.
